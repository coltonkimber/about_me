                    <b><h3>Pool:</h3></b>
                    I love playing Pool at my local bar. I won't claim to be great at it, but I should probably be a lot better based on the amount I end up playing.

                While it's not my favorite game in the world, I find myself spending a lot of time playing this game because it's a good way to catch up with my friend in Boston.

                <p>The LA Kings are my favorite NHL team and I'm counting down the days until Hockey season starts again. Go! Kings! Go!</p>

                <br>
                When time (and mostly money) allows, I like modifying my car to make it my own.
