<h1>Nikki</h1>
<p>She is an incredibly spoiled Alaskan Malamute that loves yelling at me all day long if she is not getting the attention that she feels she deserves.</p>

<h1>Sasha</h1>
<p>She is the yonger of the two dogs and is a mix between a Black Lab and a Chesapeake Bay. She is very hyperactive and thinks she is way more tough than she really is.
